The fastest and simplest way to start using LaTeX is through an online LaTeX editor. Among them [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a great option. 

If you choose to install LaTeX on your computer, it will take about an hour of your time. To have latex running in IntelliJ or PyCharm follow the installation guide.

## Installation
- Step 1: Install [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). It will install the latex tools including a tex compiler. 
- Step 2: Install [TexiFy](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9473-texify-idea) JetBrains extension. It will prepare the IDE to run and compile .tex files. This extension can also be found at File/Settings/Plugins.
- Step 3: Install [PDF Viewer](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14494-pdf-viewer) JetBrains extension. The IDE will then be able to open PDF files. This extension can also be found at File/Settings/Plugins.
